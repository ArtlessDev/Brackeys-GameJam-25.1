#SIMPLIFIED GDD

IDEAS:
- Nothing can go wrong      
    puzzle platformer
    mystery dungeon style dungeon crawling puzzle game
    diner dash <- picked this one
    heist game
    machine maintenance

GOALS OF JAM (AT LEAST ONE)
-background music   [DONE]
-sound effects      [DONE]
-animations         [NOT REALLY *BUT* I DID LEARN TO FLIP SPRITES and rotate but rotating was honestly more of a waste of time once i learned to flip them]
-camera follow
-dialogue with options to interact

Conclusion:
    I didnt really like the theme of the jam but thats just whats gonna happen, thats ok. i did however get bored with making this game in particular. not really sure as to why but at least i was very efficient with my time while working on the game and its at least enjoyable to play. I'm not one to act like i love everything i do and theres still work to be done for this game but if it does well in the Jam then i might iterate on it some more. finding and adding background music and sfx was definitely easier than i had anticipated so ill be ure to add that more consistently in the future. i dont know about *making* my own audio still but im at least more open to it.
